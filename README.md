Hi,
This is a simple Python file about MOVIE!

----------------------
Document description:
/static   #store the picture about ratings and actors
/templates    # store the html file. 
Final_project.py    # include some functions
'flask_movie.py'    # RUN
-----------------------
RUN the flask_movie.py
and OPEN the link
-----------------------
ABOUT the HTML:

First, ENTER the movie name you want to search
(e.g. The Truman Show)

Second, we will list some important actors in the movie.
And you would ENTER the actor name on the list above.
(PLEASE enter the correct name, pay attention to capital and lowercase letters! )
##IMPORTANT!##

Thrid, we will search the actor's filmography, and list these movies' rating~~

-----------------------
Have a try!
